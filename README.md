## The Basics

**Description and Responsibilities**

The role of the cybersecurity analysts is to protect organizational infrastructure such as computer networks, company hardware, software, and networks from cybercriminals and hackers. These hackers intend to steal or damage sensitive information from companies, and usually sell it to other hackers. Cybersecurity analysts use various programs and tools to assist them with their tasks such as port-scanners, special operating systems, and programming knowledge. At a small company, a cybersecurity analyst might expect to perform a variety of cybersecurity tasks. At larger organizations, one might specialize as one part of a larger security team. Some examples of responsibilities that cybersecurity analysts would have on a daily basis would be investigating security breaches, locating network vulnerabilities, performing ethical hacking, and installing security software. They are also tasked with researching new IT trends and keeping updated with new security software.

## Methods of Experiential Learning for Cybersecurity

The biggest method of learning cybersecurity is self-teaching through online programs. It is an excellent method for gaining knowledge with no prior experience, and most of the resources are free. Experiential learning and doing cybersecurity or IT related projects is integral to learning and creating a portfolio for future jobs.

**Learning Programming Languages:** Get acquainted with various programming languages, as senior cybersecurity analysts are often using Python in their daily job.

**Log Your Projects:** Create an online portfolio with personal projects in which demonstrate relative practical skills that can be applied to the workplace

**Cybersecurity Contests:** Participate in cybersecurity events or competitions. For example, in Canada there are the [CyberSci competitions](https://cybersecuritychallenge.ca/) for university and college students. 

**Cooperative education:** Gain some practical experience through internships. It does not have to be related to cybersecurity, as developer jobs help with shifting towards information technology. Being familiar with development workspace, and proving you have the skills required for software development.
