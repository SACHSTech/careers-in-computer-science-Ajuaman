# Careers in Computer Science - Tate Chin

## Section 1.1: The Basics

The career I have chosen is Cybersecurity Analyst.

**Description and Responsibilities**

The role of the cybersecurity analysts is to protect organizational infrastructure such as computer networks, company hardware, software, and networks from cybercriminals and hackers. These hackers intend to steal or damage sensitive information from companies. These analysts use various programs and tools to assist them with their tasks such as port-scanners, special operating systems, and programming knowledge. Some examples of responsibilities that cybersecurity analysts would have on a daily basis would be investigating security breaches, working with teams to locate network vulnerabilities, perform ethical hacking, and install security software.

### Skills: Technical and Non-Technical

**Technical Skills**

The main technical skills required to be a cybersecurity analyst would be proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Java, or C++ , knowledge of ethical hacking tools such as Nmap or social engineering, and Network Security Control such as firewalls, routers, or detecting unauthorized traffic. 

**Non-Technical Skills**
Some non-technical skills required for a career in cybersecurity would be communication skills when working in a team, time-management, critical thinking, and problem solving.


**Required Education and Salary Range**

Some of the educational requirements for going into cybersecurity or information technology jobs would be a degree in computer science or in IT systems engineering. For an entry level position the average salary generally starts at around $76,850 per year, while most experienced or senior workers make up to $131,250 per year on average. Refer to the table below for a general salary range

## Section 1.3: Methods of Experiential Learning for Cybersecurity

The biggest method of learning cybersecurity is self-teaching through online programs. It is an excellent method for gaining knowledge with no prior experience, and most of the resources are free. Experiential learning and doing cybersecurity or IT related projects is integral to learning and creating a portfolio for future jobs.

**Learning Programming Languages:** Get acquainted with various programming languages, as senior cybersecurity analysts are often using Python in their daily job.

**Log Your Projects:** Create an online portfolio with personal projects in which demonstrate relative practical skills that can be applied to the workplace

**Cybersecurity Contests:** Participate in cybersecurity events or competitions. For example, in Canada there are the [CyberSci competitions](https://cybersecuritychallenge.ca/) for university and college students. 

Cooperative education: Gain some practical experience through internships. It does not have to be related to cybersecurity, as developer jobs help with shifting towards information technology. Being familiar with development workspace, and proving you have the skills required for software development.
