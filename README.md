## Section 1.1: The Basics

The career I have chosen is Cybersecurity Analyst.

**Description and Responsibilities**

The role of the cybersecurity analysts is to protect organizational infrastructure such as computer networks, company hardware, software, and networks from cybercriminals and hackers. These hackers intend to steal or damage sensitive information from companies. These analysts use various programs and tools to assist them with their tasks such as port-scanners, special operating systems, and programming knowledge. Some examples of responsibilities that cybersecurity analysts would have on a daily basis would be investigating security breaches, working with teams to locate network vulnerabilities, perform ethical hacking, and install security software.

### Skills: Technical and Non-Technical
